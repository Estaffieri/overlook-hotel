# Overlook Hotel

In this project I build a hotel management tool to be used by both hotel customers and managers to manage room bookings and calculate customer bills. This project has an emphasis on:

- Working with an API to send and recieve data
- Sass & responsive design
- Test Driven Development for a client-side application


The details of the original FitLit project are outlined in the [Turing project page](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/overlook.html).

## Goals & Objectives
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
